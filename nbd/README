Access Playstation (1 & 2) memory cards using Sony's official PS3 USB adapter
as regular block devices via an NBD server.

Dependencies:
- python-libusb1: http://github.com/vpelletier/python-libusb1

Requirements:
- USB host runing Linux (ie: any computer with USB ports)
- For PS2 card access only, an authentication daemon (see below)

Installation:
- as root:
  - copy udev/playstation-card-reader.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
  - restart udev

Usage:
- plug your PS3 usb adapter
- Start the NBD server: ./main.py
- As root:
  - bind NBD server to an nbd device: nbd-client 127.0.0.1 20530 /dev/nbd0
  - do whatever you want to do with the nbd device
    Example:
      dd if=/dev/nbd0 of=ps_card.img bs=1024
  - unbind device: nbd-client -d /dev/nbd0
- Stop NBD server (ex, with a ctrl-c)

Notes:
Transfer speed is very low: 10kB/s for PS1 cards, 20kB/s for PS2 cards on my
system.
Just as any other device, don't unplug it without properly
unbinding/unmounting it before. Same goes for removing the card from the
reader.

Authentication Daemon:
PS2 card access requires the host (computer) to authenticate itself to the
card reader. This authentication mechanism is not reverse-engineered. Hence,
the NBD server was written with support for an external daemon doing auth
work. This way, it can (indirectly) use an actual PS3 as authentication data
source. See "psp" directory on this repository for an authentication daemon.
